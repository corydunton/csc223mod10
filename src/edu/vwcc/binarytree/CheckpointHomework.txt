Figure 21-1 (A Better Picture is in Gaddis - page 1288)

21.1	Consider the binary tree T shown in Figure 21-1.
a)	List the ancestors of each node G.
b)	List the descendants of each node of C.
c)	List all the leaf nodes of tree T.
d)	List all the non-leaf nodes of tree T.
e)	Show the nodes of T as output by a preorder traversal.
f)	Show the nodes of T as output by a postorder traversal.
g)	Show the nodes of T as output by an inorder traversal.

21.2	Show the output from a postorder traversal of the two trees in Figure 21-1

21.3	Show the output from a preorder traversal of the two trees in Figure 21-1
 
21.4 Using the Node class defined in this section, draw the binary tree constructed by the following statements:
    Node left = new Node(10, new Node(20), new Node(2O));
    Node right = new Node(60, new Node(180), null);
    Node tree = new Node(160, left, right);

then list the nodes of the resulting binary tree in preorder.
